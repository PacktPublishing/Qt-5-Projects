# Qt 5 Projects
This is the code repository for [Qt 5 Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/qt-5-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293884), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The projects I have for you are not just meant to show you how powerful and easy it is to build complete applications and rich user interfaces with Qt (you could find out that on your own, I assume you are smart), but first and foremost, they are meant to show you how to do that by writing maintainable code that you'll want to touch and expand upon without regret any time you feel like it. And that requires a little experience. In the end, that's what I am offering you above anything else: my experience as a software developer who uses Qt daily to fulfill my customers' and my own needs.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
# part1-whats_in_my_fridge.pro
TEMPLATE = subdirs

SUBDIRS += usecases
```

In this book, I assume you already have a basic understanding of common data structures and algorithms. You should also be familiar with the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). A working knowledge of C++11 is required for all projects. JavaScript 5 is required for the projects involving the QML language.
